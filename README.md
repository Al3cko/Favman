Due to lack of donations newer versions of favtool will be now distributed via patreon. 
This trully was a suffered decision, but i cannot afford to maintain this project active as I wantend. I don't know if this will be forever but I have to try, to save this project from death.

# Possible FAQ

Yes If you have ever donated any sum to this project via paypal, you can probably still sen me a message there. I will be glad to sed you a link that will allows you to download the lates version of favtool.

### will this repository get removed?
No, nor the 4.3 release, you will be able to donload that release for the moment 

### will i have to pay every new release?
No, it's a one time purchase, that will allow you to download all the future releases of favtool

### whats about the source?
I don't really know, for the moment the download will not include the source. I have to get educated about the different types of licences, then I will include the source of every version I published. Favtool will be an open source project, I don't want you to execute some strange app you found on the internet. let's say it is a temporary solution. (NO, OPEN SOURCE DOES NOT IMPLY FREE)
